# odin-recipes
This is my first "project" for Odin foundations lesson.
The goal of this project is to make a webpage about recipes to practice what I've learned so far:
- initial HTML (boilerplate) structure with heading
- create and populate recipe page with content (heading, image, description, paragraphs, lists)
- link recipe page to index
